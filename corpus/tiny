NEW FALLOUT FROM CHERNOBYL;
</P>
<P>
THE SOCIAL IMPACT OF THE CHERNOBYL DISASTER BY DAVID R. MARPLES (ST. MARTIN'S
PRESS: $35, CLOTH; $14.95, PAPER; 316 PP., ILLUSTRATED; 0-312-02432-0)

By James E. Oberg , Oberg, a space engineer in Houston, is the author of
Uncovering Soviet Disasters: Exploring the Limits of Glasnost (Random House).
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The onset of the new Gorbachev policy of glasnost, commonly mistranslated as
openness but closer in connotation to candor or publicizing, has complicated
the task of Soviet secret-keepers and has allowed substantial new Western
insights into Soviet society. David R. Marples' new book, his second on the
Chernobyl accident of April 26, 1986, is a shining example of the best type of
non-Soviet analysis into topics that only recently were absolutely taboo in
Moscow official circles.
</P>
<P>
The author, a British-educated historian and economist, is a research associate
with the Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies at the University of Alberta,
and the academic style of the book is undisguised. However, its intended
audience is the general public, and anyone interested in nuclear power, or
Soviet economy and society, or human drama, or just plain sleuthing state
secrets, will find hitherto unpublished revelations and explanations of the
event and its continuing aftermath.
</P>
<P>
The effects of Chernobyl reverberated throughout so many facets of Soviet
society that a continuous coherent narrative is probably impossible. Marples
discusses half a dozen major themes arranged in a fairly arbitrary order (as
indicated by the frequent and helpful cross references throughout the text) and
succeeds in mapping out his main themes. The personal interests of each reader
determine which of the sections may be deemed too detailed and which too
sketchy, but considering the need for such a comprehensive overview, the levels
are generally appropriate.
</P>
<P>
The book is, on the one hand, not a light read, and an executive summary might
have been possible in a quarter the length. But, on the other, so many of the
judgments depend on a subtle interpretation of a multitude of sources that the
author is obligated to present the raw data for the reader's inspection. The
modular nature of the book also allows a reader to skip, browse, and revisit
earlier sections, aided by a convenient internal organization and a thorough
index.
</P>
<P>
First in the world's attention, and in the text, is a discussion of the human
victims of the accident. The official tally is 31 (only about 20 names have
ever been released), but Marples suspects there were other short-term radiation
victims. A large number of unnecessary late-term abortions were also performed
on local women, and by rights those unborn babies count as casualties.
Widespread "radiophobia" led to restricted diets which created malnourishment
and subsequent disease in thousands of people. The tens of thousands of people
taking part in cleanup operations were never included in official totals of
those exposed. Since the book went to press, Soviet military sources have
referred to at least one death in the actual reactor entombment program.
</P>
<P>
But the greatest toll is likely to occur with the delayed deaths. Here, Marples
encounters for the first time the soon familiar theme of official Soviet
myth-making around the event: Reality is twisted to serve state policy
objectives, which include calming an alarmed public with assurances that all is
well when it isn't.
</P>
<P>
And thus is born what he properly labels the "myth of Chernobyl," the official
line that the disaster provided a test that Soviet society passed with honor.
"In the Soviet view," he writes, "it was first and foremost a victory, a story
with an ending, and an ending that was triumphant."
</P>
<P>
Thus, when sober Western medical estimates placed the future "excess cancer
deaths" at several tens of thousands, both in the Soviet Union and in Europe (a
few tenths of a percent elevation of the natural cancer rate), the Soviets
reacted furiously. The estimates are branded "nonsense" and the estimators are
dismissed as "panic mongers" promulgating "anti-Soviet venom."
</P>
<P>
Subsequently the author addresses themes of environmental impact, economic and
political repercussions, public images, and the recovery operations. Along the
way, Marples provides a damning list of examples in which Soviet officials
attempted to retreat behind old-style cover-ups and outright lies. False
information was issued on radiation levels, on subsequent accidents at the
site, on contamination levels of the Kiev water supply, on severe discipline
against non-volunteer cleanup personnel, on reactor entombment schedules and on
operator training levels.
</P>
<P>
A severe 1986-1987 countrywide electrical power shortage was officially denied
although it was real enough to compel the restart of three Chernobyl reactors
in explicit violation of Soviet safety regulations. Design deficiencies of the
Chernobyl-style reactors were downplayed and human errors were declared to be
the primary culprit.
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, observes the author, "It is ironic that in an era of openness,
Chernobyl may have been both the pioneer of glasnost under Gorbachev and then
subsequently its first casualty." He ultimately concludes, "Aspects of the
disaster . . . have rarely been dealt with thoroughly or even honestly by
Soviet sources." Hence the need for this book, a need which is admirably
fulfilled despite the many remaining mysteries and uncertainties.
</P>
<P>
The July, 1987, trial of reactor personnel marked a full circle of disclosure.
Journalists were allowed into the pre-scripted first and last days, but the
weeklong deliberative sessions were held in secret and no word of their
substance has ever been released.
</P>
<P>
The propaganda purpose of the trial and surrounding official publicity, he
maintains, had one goal: "To divert culpability from the party hierarchy, in
Kiev and especially in Moscow." This is precisely the theme I have also
encountered in my own investigations of aerospace accidents of the past. Where
individual human failings led to catastrophe, a sanitized story may eventually
be released, but where Kremlin policy led to disaster (such as the Nedelin
catastrophe of 1960 or the Soyuz-1 disaster in 1967), the entire event remains
absolutely off limits to glasnost.
</P>
<P>
The closing blow-by-blow description of the nuclear power debate presages a
dramatic event which occurred too recently for inclusion in this first edition.
Viktor Legasov, tagged by the author as one of the country's two leading
pro-nuclear advocates, actually was sinking into private despair over the poor
implementation of safety standards. In the end, he made his final and most
eloquent testimony to this despair on the second anniversary of the accident,
by committing suicide. For several weeks the Soviets tried to sit on the
circumstances of his "tragic death," even issuing official non-explanations
which asserted that the death was not due to medical effects of radiation.
Finally, crusading journalist Vladimir Gubarev, with access to Legasov's
notebooks, broke the story in Pravda. Readers of this book will come to know
these and other characters so well that the suicide fits right into the "big
picture" of the catastrophe's social impacts.
</P>
<P>
For an author to so accurately describe a social milieu that subsequent
unpredictable events only enhance his insights is testimony to the highest
quality of scholarship. Readers of Marples' book will rarely be surprised as
the Chernobyl catastrophe's consequences continue to unfold in the future.

THE ARISTOCRAT AS INDEPENDENT VOTER;
</P>
<P>
TOCQUEVILLE A BIOGRAPHY BY ANDRE JARDIN; TRANSLATED BY LYDIA DAVIS WITH ROBERT
HEMENWAY(FARRAR, STRAUS &amp; GIROUX: $30; 548 PP.)
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Annette J. Smith and David R. Smith , Both Smiths are professors at Caltech
and co-translators and editors of 'Mademoiselle Irnois' and Other Stories by
Arthur de Gobineau (University of California Press), who was, among other
things, Tocqueville's secretary.
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Andre Jardin's "Tocqueville," surprisingly the first full-scale biography of
this major 19th-Century figure, is a fine, old-fashioned piece of work, some of
it original, much of it taken from the ample precedent scholarship. It provides
an abundant store of information and an occasional surprise -- a dozen years
after its publication, we find the author of "Democracy in America," now
minister of foreign affairs, exclaiming: "But what animals these Americans
are!"
</P>
<P>
It is as the author of "Democracy in America" that Tocqueville is known in this
country; but what this biography reveals is not so much an admirer of America
as a Frenchman of his time, circumstance and needs, even when he is in America.
He came here with his friend Beaumont ostensibly as a student of penitentiary
reform, but Tocqueville really wanted to take a larger look at this new
republic, since it was clear to him that the European drift was in that
direction, and what intrigued him was its democratic base, since he had been
brought up to believe that a republic could function only when run by a
virtuous elite. We know what he found and how he responded, but the biography
also reveals, almost inadvertently, why he was such an accurate and
comparatively unbiased observer.
</P>
<P>
For one thing, he had not biased himself by reading contemporary travel
literature, much of it written by snide Tories pretending to take an
unprejudiced look at the American experiment. Capt. Basil Hall's infamous
"Travels" had been only partially translated (the chapter on prison reform)
into French, and, in any event, it was his companion Beaumont who read it. The
result was that Tocqueville's vision had not been prejudiced (other than by his
relative Chateaubriand's romance with New World nature). For another,
Tocqueville and Beaumont readied themselves each day by preparing questions for
the people they would meet, questions based upon their own observations sur
place and designed to elicit responses useful to them as Frenchmen trying to
prepare themselves for a possible future. They were not, as were the Tories,
justifying a past.
</P>
<P>
Tocqueville's Cartesian clarity, his relative lack of bias, meant that he used
the answers to his questions to form a useful statement about America, but the
questions themselves and their reasons reveal perhaps even more about France.
By looking at this intelligent, open-minded, and inquiring young civil servant
and nobleman of impeccable political parentage (great grandson of Malesherbes),
Jardin's book provides the American reader a marvelous introduction to the
political shiftings, the gradual yet sometimes violent post-revolutionary
cracking of the political structure in France as it grappled simultaneously
with the shattered legitimacy of the past, a slippery present and an
ill-defined future.
</P>
<P>
After the immediate success of "Democracy in America" (1835), Tocqueville
entered the political arena and was elected deputy for the arrondissement of
Valognes, the region of his family castle in Normandy. He sat left of center in
the Chamber. Although many at the time thought of him as an Carlist aristocrat
and some in this country think of him as an American-style conservative,
Tocqueville considered the old aristocracy "dead for ever." Over the years, he
demonstrated his liberalism by fighting for parliamentary monarchy, separation
of church and state, reform of the suffrage laws, improvement of the worker's
lot, for liberalizing public education, abolishing slavery wherever it existed,
improving the prison system and eliminating poverty. He managed, nevertheless,
to stay clear of several more powerful champions of liberal causes such as
Lamartine, Royer-Collard, and Thiers, who would have liked to have him on their
side but whose egos he mistrusted.
</P>
<P>
Independence is what most characterizes Tocqueville's career. A colleague
reproached him for "giving the right hand to the left, the left to the right
and regretting that he does not have a third one to give invisibly." "Freedom
is the strongest of my passions. Voila. It is the truth," he explained to
disconcerted observers. If he moved left, it was, he claimed, to impose his
color on the left, not change his own.
</P>
<P>
Another constant was his hatred of centralization. In "L'Ancien Regime et la
Revolution," Tocqueville analyzed the roots of centralization in France, which
according to him went as far back as the reign of Philip the Fair in the Middle
Ages. He lamented the fact that centralization had destroyed time-tested local
organic structures and that the French nobility itself was at fault in the
process. Tocqueville fought centralism in all of its manifestations as he saw
them. For instance, rather an agnostic himself, he defended religious education
because he believed in the healthy necessity of a third force besides the state
and the people.
</P>
<P>
Tocqueville's anticentralism colored his responses to the various colonial
enterprises that characterize European history of the period. Thus, in newly
conquered Algeria, he favored a kind of settlement based on local autonomy
rather than central metropolitan power. He was the first man in the Chamber to
push for a separate ministry for Algeria -- a dream that became a fact only a
century later in Leon Blum's cabinet. He deplored the downfall of the Ottoman
Empire in the Middle East, since the Turks were not only a desirable bumper
between the major European predators, but also relatively tolerant themselves
toward the diversity of their possessions. He admired the respect for local
customs that the British had shown in India.
</P>
<P>
Tocqueville was an active, intelligent legislator, esteemed particularly for
his work on penitentiary reform (inspired by the Philadelphia system) and on
the abolition of slavery, but he was not a sensational figurehead. One might
say that, like Montaigne, he had lived through a great deal of political
turmoil and managed to preserve an independent judgment. When Louis-Napoleon
was propelled into the presidency at the end of the bloody 1848 revolution,
Tocqueville was given the foreign affairs ministry in the Barrot cabinet. He
served with the same unsensational distinction as in the Chamber but was fired
after only five months. He had protested Louis-Napoleon's coup d'etat that made
an emperor of the president and was briefly imprisoned in Vincennes -- luckier
in this than one of our great-grandfathers, who was sent to the Sahara for the
same offense. From then to his death from tuberculosis in Cannes in 1859,
Tocqueville led the life of a gentleman farmer and journalist who, amid
numerous changes of residence to accommodate his health, wrote (but did not
finish) "L'Ancien Regime et la Revolution."
</P>
<P>
This long and scrupulous study of a man who was one of the most profound and
prophetic thinkers of his time, is, alas, scrupulous to the point of boredom.
The narration rarely deviates from an inexhaustible concatenation of facts
related in the soberest of prose. Although it does justice to Tocqueville's
ideas, it fails in rendering the passion and the grace of his intellectual life
and the social brilliance of the era. Moreover, the book is curiously
organized: The order followed a mixture of the chronological and of the
thematic, with several baffling leaps from one to the other. Andre Jardin's
work constitutes an excellent work of reference for the scholar. It is indexed
and substantially but not cumbersomely footnoted. Still it makes the layman
yearn for the livelier manner of much recent historical writing.

TUNGSTEN A NOVEL BY CESAR VALLEJO; TRANSLATED BY ROBERT MEZEY; FOREWORD BY
KEVIN J. O'CONNOR (SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY PRESS: $19.95; 168 PP.; 0-8156-0226-X)

By Edith Grossman, Grossman is a critic and translator of Latin American
literature. She teaches at Dominican College in New York State, is the author
of The Antipoetry of Nicanor Parra and recently translated Gabriel Garcia
Marquez's Love in the Time of Cholera.
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Why read "Tungsten," a partisan novel written almost 60 years ago in which evil
is unmitigated, virtue unblemished, and the characters seem to lack dimension
or complexity as they play out their predetermined roles on the stage of the
class struggle? Why read a book in which ideology reigns supreme, and why
celebrate its first, belated translation into English? Because the author is
Cesar Vallejo, one of the great poets of the 20th Century and a major figure in
Latin American literature.
</P>
<P>
Vallejo created a wrenching poetic language for Spanish that radically altered
the shape of its imagery and the nature of its rhythms. No facile trend setter,
Vallejo forged a new discourse in order to express his own visceral compassion
for human suffering. He saw the world in piercing flashes of outrage and
anguish, terror and pity, and what he saw wounded him like knife thrusts. A
passionate, tragic poet, he mourned our loss of moral innocence and despaired
of the injustice that moves the world. In the late 1920s, when he was living in
Paris and eking out a meager livelihood as a journalist, the pain at the roots
of his being found objective substantiation in radical politics.
</P>
<P>
Born in the Peruvian Andes in 1892, he witnessed firsthand the victimization
and exploitation of the South American Indians. Although his own family was not
financially destitute (his father was a notary and minor bureaucrat in the
small town of Santiago de Chuco), Vallejo was a cholo, a person born of mixed
European and Indian ancestry. The fact is not irrelevant. In a society where
social and economic status followed the color line with cosmic certainty, where
racial discrimination was rigidly adhered to although rarely acknowledged in
public, the representatives of foreign companies, with the wholehearted
complicity of domestic colleagues, extracted high profits from the near-slavery
of the illiterate, utterly alienated and ultimately helpless victims of that
racism. Vallejo had ample opportunity to witness the brutalization en masse of
the Indian underclass and the appalling greed of their lighter-skinned masters
who carried on the colonial tradition of using Indians as forced labor in mines
and on plantations.
</P>
<P>
Twentieth-Century writers from Ciro Alegria to Manuel Scorza have denounced the
Peruvian tragedy in their books. "Tungsten" was one of the earliest novels to
do so in modern terms. As a young man, however, Vallejo's greatest energies
were devoted to writing and publishing his poems ("Los heraldos negros," his
first book, appeared in 1918); consequently, he remained on the periphery of
the windstorms of political and social unrest that swept through South America
in the second decade of the century, although he was in the time and place
where growing agitation to establish justice for Peruvian Indians and workers
began its inexorable march toward Marxism.
</P>
<P>
Vallejo, Jose Carlos Mariategui (the "Shining Path" in today's Peru takes its
name from his writings) and Victor Raul Haya de la Torre (a founder of the
important APRA movement -- the "Popular Revolutionary American Alliance")
crossed paths at the university in Trujillo. But Vallejo was an intermittent
student. His family began to experience economic difficulties during his
adolescence, and he was obliged to interrupt secondary school and then his
university studies to take a series of jobs, which included office work in the
mines at Tambores and Quiruvilca, and on a large sugar plantation in the
Chicama Valley.
</P>
<P>
These facts are not irrelevant either. They provided the historical raw
material for "Tungsten," the documented background to Vallejo's outcry against
the grim realities of Indian life in Peru. The shape that material would take
-- his conviction that the problem of race was indistinguishable from the
problem of class -- was determined by his increasingly active commitment to
socialism, a political engagement that, by 1930, led to his expulsion from
France, where he had gone to live seven years earlier.
</P>
<P>
The action of the novel is centered in a fictional mining town and its
provincial capital, Colca. The time is 1917, just before the U.S. entry into
World War I when a ready supply of tungsten would be crucial to the weapons
industry. A North American corporation takes over the mine, and the boom is on:
Peasants are first lured and then coerced into working for the company, local
Indians, the Soras, are cheated of their land and animals, petit bourgeois
entrepreneurs scramble on the backs of the poor for wealth and position, and
venal officials and dignitaries find a new source of bribery and
power-brokering in the foreign capitalists. The first two-thirds of the book,
in fact, constitutes a genre study of unashamed thuggery, a series of vignettes
of corruption, repression and brutality that sets the stage for the violent
heart of "Tungsten" and the appearance of its proletarian Indian hero, Servando
Huanca.
</P>
<P>
Two Indian boys are forcibly conscripted into military service (the military as
well as the mining contractors have "body quotas" -- numbers of recruits or
workers that must be obtained by any means), and on the long march from their
homes to Colca, when they are tied by the waist to the mules that their captors
ride, they are so badly abused that one of them eventually dies. Outside the
Subprefecture an angry crowd gathers, indignant at the visible signs of the
conscripts' mistreatment. One defiant man, Servando Huanca, steps forward to
speak for the crowd with natural authority and an instinctive class
consciousness. These qualities inspire the people and momentarily cow the
authorities, but then the troops are ordered to fire into the crowd, and later
that night officially sanctioned vigilantes pursue any Indian they can find,
shooting to kill. Some, however, are taken into custody, and deals are struck
by sleazy officials which allow the prisoners to be sent off to a sure death in
the mines to help fulfill the company's "body quota."
</P>
<P>
Last and certainly least, the third section of the book is a kind of postscript
to the Colca massacre. Vallejo allows his indignation and passion to turn into
mechanical ideology: Servando Huanca "duckspeaks" a mercifully brief exercise
in orthodoxy, proclaiming that world revolution is under way, that it will be
led by a militant proletariat inspired by Lenin and not by bourgeois
"intellectuals," that it will sweep away the ruling classes in Peru. Vallejo
even permits the novel to end with this ponderously symbolic sentence:
"Outside, the wind was rising, portending storm."
</P>
<P>
Kevin J. O'Connor has written a thoughtful and informative foreword, Robert
Mezey has done a fine job of translating Vallejo's often quirky Spanish, and
both of them deserve our gratitude for their sensitivity and skill in bringing
the work to the attention of an English-language audience. I am sorry that I
cannot say as much for the editing. The typographical errors are frequent and
unforgivable, and there is no indication as one reads that Mezey has provided
important end notes to the text. This is a disservice to the reader; Vallejo
and his translator deserve better.

EXTINCT IN THE LAND OF FIRE;
</P>
<P>
WHO WILL REMEMBER THE PEOPLE BY JEAN RASPAIL; TRANSLATED BY JEREMY LEGGATT
(MERCURY HOUSE: $18.95; 215 PP.)
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Schmitt , Schmitt is a professor of Latin American literature at CSU
Long Beach whose latest work is a translation of Chilean poet Raul Zurita's
Anteparadise (University of California Press).

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The four tribes of the now-extinct native Americans that once inhabited the
Tierra del Fuego archipelago -- that ships' graveyard along the land's end,
southern tip of South America -- were among the most primitive and hardy
peoples encountered in the New World. In this fine piece of historical fiction
cum-exemplary story, French novelist Jean Raspail explores the sad fate of the
Alacalufs (who called themselves Kaweskar, "The People"), the lesser known of
the two tribes of sea-nomads or "canoe Indians."
</P>
<P>
Raspail reconstructs the history of the Alacalufs through their own eyes and
those of Magellan, Drake and other historical figures. In this noble quest of
the "other" (those whose languages and customs seemed so alien to Europeans
that they refused to admit that they belonged to the human species), the view
from "within" is attempted through a synopsis of generations, of millennia, in
the mind of the character Lafko, a kind of collective memory of the Alacalufs.
The view from "without" reveals a shameful history of smug disdain: From
Magellan on, Europeans judged the Alacalufs to be "ugly," "stinking,"
"disgusting," "brutish," "beasts," "animals"; they kidnaped them, enslaved them
and, at worst, their genocidal instincts unleashed, they turned their guns and
cannons on them for sport, exterminated them; in the end, they were hunted for
bounty or herded into missionary stations where they died of white man's
diseases or the despair of captivity, and the last stragglers were reduced to
bartering and begging in the shipping lanes of the Strait of Magellan. The
complicity of scientists (like Darwin) in fostering this outcome is addressed
in a couple of the chapters.
</P>
<P>
The other side of the coin -- that our survival, too, depends on our ability to
embrace others not as a function of our own ideal but of theirs -- is seen in
the tragic fate of the inhabitants of Name of Jesus and the City of King
Philip, Spain's first settlement communities in Tierra del Fuego,who went mad
or starved to death. The English privateer Cavendish rechristened the latter
city Port Famine.
</P>
<P>
The point is brought home in the moving chapter, "A Civilized Gentleman." Sir
John Byron, shipwrecked in the Strait in his youth and rescued by the
Alacalufs, returns to the scene years later and ponders the legacy of European
contacts: "What an endless history of contempt is unraveled! And yet . . . ."
An instinct for survival had not saved his fellow castaways. He alone had
survived by crossing the cultural abyss and living with the Alacaluf clan for
six months, and the clan had braved the seas and their fears of the world
beyond their territory to set him down on an island from which Chilotan seal
hunters returned him to Puerto Montt.
</P>
<P>
But when Raspail attempts to give us a glimpse from within (the inner life of
the Alacalufs), the reader is aware of a European mind wedged between him and
the "other." The Alacalufs are "endlessly fleeing," "forsaken" pariahs,
"commanded by fate to survive, not to live" in a land shrouded in "an eternally
black sky," "a witches' dance of cruel winds," "a hell of snow and winds."
</P>
<P>
But this area is also stunningly beautiful, and Father Martin Gusinde has
compared the Yamana, a sister tribe, to 'fidgety birds of passage who were
happy and inwardly calm only when they were on the move'). In two recent works,
Bruce Chatwin ("The Songlines") and Mario Vargas Llosa ("El Hablador" ("The
Speaker") ) convincingly draw the reader into the soul-life, the Earth-bound
myths and legends of the Australian Bushmen and the Peruvian Machiguengas,
respectively. Raspail is far less successful in a parallel attempt with the
Alacalufs, and the fault is not in Jeremy Leggatt's translation, which is
excellent.
</P>
<P>
Despite that limitation, Raspail's story, inscribed in the dialogue of cultures
so characteristic of our age, is a fine version in historical fiction of a true
story loud with ethical reverberations. As First-World nations, we are
collectively responsible for the fate of colonized and subjugated peoples in
the Third World, but we have hardly begun to address those responsibilities.

ago, the youngest in the parade's history. Now, she's been invited back to be
grand marshal of the 100th Rose Parade, which starts Monday at 8 a.m. (to be
covered on various TV stations; see Watchables for details). She joins a select
group of others who have been grand marshals twice: Bob Hope, Richard Nixon and
Earl Warren.

This novel's hip style, smooth tone and sensual spirit distinctively recall the
music of Steely Dan, a resemblance which turns out to be more than accidental,
for Marcelle Clements lives with Donald Fagen, Steely Dan's lead singer and
composer. Clements, a journalist, wrote "Rock Me" in part to evoke the lives of
the musicians she first met at New York City's High School of Music and Art and
then toured with in a yearlong stint as one of Fagen's backup singers. On this
level, "Rock Me" is absorbing and believable. Casey and Michael, Clements'
protagonists, are accurate portrayals of 1960s rockers grappling with the late
1980s. Up on shrinks, down on drugs (after years of riding high) and longing
for friendship though often sidetracked by lust, they speak in a delightfully
spacey dialect from somewhere in between the San Fernando Valley and the New
School for Social Research: "It's just been a horrible grind for so long,"
Casey tells Michael, "that now I have this, like, unbelievable negative tropism
about all of it."
</P>
<P>
Sometimes Clements' language, with no evidence of satire, strays from the
eccentric to the insipid. "You really have a great tan," Casey tells Michael.
"I hope so," he responds. "Because that's all I have." Clements' point of view
is also stylistically problematic, changing from first to third person for no
apparent reason. A final problem is Clements' attempt to study a love triangle.
Casey, the burnt-out lead singer in a highly successful band, leaves New York
City to recuperate in Hawaii. There, she meets Michael, her former lover and
band partner, and his girlfriend Leslie. Sensing the desire between Casey and
Michael, Leslie, hardly monogamous herself, sanctions an affair between the
two. Casey and Michael eventually make love, but rather than confronting her
feelings toward Michael, Casey abruptly returns to New York, riddled with guilt
over her "dirty deed."
</P>
<P>
Clements' portrait of Casey, nevertheless, is an intimate and credible sketch
of a neurotic artist. Casey returns to New York confused, but creatively
reinvigorated, concluding that she can only realize her fantasies in her music:
"The best affair is the affair you don't have . . . except in your songs."

Thanks to ABC and Marlo Thomas for sharing a holiday gift with us. "Free to Be

the planet must be preserved for our precious children.

MEMORIES OF A CHINESE-AMERICAN BOYHOOD;

When I think of some friends of mine from the old neighborhood (all of whom had
the proper ethnic credentials, let me assure you), one thing I remember is our
wariness of what we called "I Have a Problem" literature. By that, we meant
literature of ethnic experience at its most tiresome: brooding, Angst-ridden
story-polemics, crammed to the gills with resentment and righteous anger, about
existential misery in the Land of the Round-Eye; literature that seemed to
assume that any bit of drivel was worth your attention just as long as it had a
chip on its shoulder. It's a species related to what Calvin Trillin called the
"kvetch novel" -- any novel in which you want to say to the main character,
"Oh, just pull up your socks" -- only more irritating. But it's also an easy
trap for anyone who writes from an ethnocentric point of view to fall into. It
is, therefore, to Frank Chin's credit that his collection of short stories,
"The Chinaman Pacific &amp; Frisco R.R. Co." by and large avoids this trap even
as it dances on the edge of the pit.
</P>
<P>
There are eight stories in this volume, most of them autobiographical in tone.
Almost all have as their essential subject the alienation of Chinese-America
from the America of white skin and Wonder Bread. The first two, "Railroad
Standard Time" and "The Eat and Run Midnight People," read like meandering
stream-of-consciousness memoirs and are self-indulgent enough to make them the
weakest of the bunch. The final story, "The Sons of Chan," clothes itself in
shreds of fiction with some interesting Freudian overtones, but it is otherwise
a tiring screed on growing up with the stereotypes in Charlie Chan movies as
your only reflection in popular culture. Chin's rhetoric is often sharp and
funny, but he also rides the high horse of racial bitterness for more than it's
worth.
</P>
<P>
It's the other five stories that distinguish "The Chinaman Pacific &amp; Frisco
R.R. Co." In them, Chin displays two considerable writerly virtues. One is a
wicked sense of humor that runs a provocative gamut from jangled whimsy to
scathing satire. His subject matter is weighty enough so that an amusing
conceit or figuration often balances out the mood. This is particularly true of
"A Chinese Lady Dies," in which the narrator's problematic (and disturbingly
Oedipal) relationship with his mother evokes such tension that the story would
self-immolate without the whimsical dream passages in which he imagines himself
as an Old-Western hero called E. Chino. His wit feels more like a dagger than a
feather, but is no less amusing for it. And for good measure, Chin tacks on an
afterword that reads suspiciously like a freewheeling satire on Maxine Hong
Kingston's "The Woman Warrior."
</P>
<P>
 His other primary virtue is his considerable skill as a storyteller. He has a
genuine gift for bringing characters and their predicaments alive. One sees
this most vividly in "The Only Real Day," which focuses on the struggle of an
aged immigrant to keep American culture at bay and preserve his identity as a
Chinese. Chin has a definite point to make in this story about the corrosion of
Chinese values and identity in a mostly white world, but the message is
filtered so thoroughly through the plot and well-drawn characters that it has
no didactic harshness. It is, above all, a poignant and entrancing piece of
fiction. "Yes, Young Daddy," which depicts the protagonist's relationship with
a female cousin who is grappling with adolescence, is also worth noting for its
skillful portraiture.
</P>
<P>
Chin's prose style tends toward a looseness vaguely reminiscent of William S.
Burroughs. It's lively stuff but also slow going at times, what with the
missing antecedents, plastic sentence structure and all. He also enjoys playing
fast and loose with temporal shifts in his stories, with the result that
memory, present experience, anticipation and pure fantasy often overlap. It's
an absorbingly dense reflection of the way in which past, present and future
come to bear upon each other in the mind, but everything melds so seamlessly
that the reader may have some trouble keeping things sorted.
</P>
<P>
On the whole, Chin does a good job of avoiding the hazards that could have
swallowed up these stories. Although alienation is the great theme of
post-World War II American literature and our age is distinguished by its
voices from outside the mainstream, just because a work is about racial
alienation doesn't automatically make it worth reading. The problem with
ethnocentric literature is that its force is so centripetal. It tends to reach
inward, instead of outward toward the universal significance that, as Northrop
Frye said, marks literature in its highest form. Fiction need not reach that
level to be worth our while, but it should at least show a human dimension that
will move us and provoke us, as mere formalized pique cannot. Fortunately, "The
Chinaman Pacific &amp; Frisco R.R. Co." achieves such transcendance often
enough to make it worthwhile fiction.
